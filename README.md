#1. A clock
- hour needle, minute needle, second needle
- a bell sound ringing at every hour

In a traditional analog clock, the second, minute, and hour hands rotate at different rates. The relationships between their rotations are as follows:

The second hand completes a full rotation every 60 seconds. The minute hand completes a full rotation every 60 minutes (1 hour). The hour hand completes a full rotation every 12 hours. Based on this information, if the second hand completes a full rotation (360 degrees), the minute hand would have moved 1/60th of a rotation (6 degrees) and the hour hand would have moved 1/720th of a rotation (0.5 degrees).

However, I did not follow that rule bcs there are some inconvenience. In stead, I just mimiced the movement speed of each hand (speed: second > minute > hour.

I reused the Rotation Matrix and Translation Matrix that professor had been taught in class, added the sound
